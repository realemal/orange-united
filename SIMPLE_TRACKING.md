## 💡 Pro Tip

**Most Important:**
Your VALUE isn't in data collection - it's in:
- ✅ **Translation** (policy → parent language)
- ✅ **Analysis** (why this matters)
- ✅ **Action** (what parents can do)

Even with just 1-2 articles per week covering meetings and curriculum, you'll be the #1 source for informed Orange parents.

**Quality over quantity!** 🎯
