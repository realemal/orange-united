## Our Mission

Orange United is a grassroots movement of parents, educators, and community members committed to excellence in Orange education. We believe that when parents and schools work together, our children thrive.

## What We Do

### Keep Parents Informed

We cover school board meetings, curriculum changes, and education policy so you don't have to sift through hours of meetings. Our team attends board sessions, reviews policy documents, and translates complex educational jargon into plain language.

### Promote Transparency

We advocate for open communication between schools, administrators, and families. Every parent deserves to know what's being taught in classrooms and how decisions affecting their children are made.

### Empower Parent Voices

We provide resources and opportunities for parents to engage meaningfully in their children's education. Whether it's understanding your rights, speaking at board meetings, or connecting with other concerned parents, we're here to help.

### Build Community

We connect like-minded parents who care about educational excellence and student success. Through events, social media, and our newsletter, we create spaces for meaningful dialogue and action.

## Our Values

- **Academic Excellence**: Every child deserves a rigorous, high-quality education
- **Parental Involvement**: Parents are partners in their children's education
- **Transparency**: School governance should be open and accessible
- **Community Engagement**: Stronger communities build stronger schools

## Our Story

Orange United was founded by concerned parents who wanted to stay informed about what was happening in Orange schools. What started as a small group attending board meetings has grown into a community of hundreds of families committed to educational excellence.

We're not affiliated with any political party or special interest group. We're simply parents who believe our children deserve the best education possible and that parent voices matter.
