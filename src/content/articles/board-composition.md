## Understanding Your School Board

The Orange Unified School Board consists of seven elected trustees who make decisions about curriculum, spending, and education policy. Understanding how the board operates helps parents engage more effectively in their children's education.

### What Parents Should Know

Understanding school board decisions helps parents:

1. **Stay Informed** - Know what's being discussed and decided at board meetings
2. **Ask Questions** - Understand curriculum choices and their impact on students
3. **Provide Input** - Participate in the public comment process effectively
4. **Engage Productively** - Work with trustees and administrators on education priorities

## How School Boards Work

School board trustees are elected to represent their communities. Many parents aren't aware of:
- When board meetings occur
- How to access meeting agendas
- The public comment process
- How to research voting records on education issues
