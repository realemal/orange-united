## The Current Situation

The Orange Unified School Board currently lacks representation from trustees who consistently prioritize parental input on curriculum decisions and educational transparency. This 7-0 dynamic means that parent concerns about academic standards, curriculum content, and fiscal responsibility often go unaddressed.

### What This Means for Parents

When board composition doesn't reflect the diversity of parent viewpoints in our community, several issues arise:

1. **Limited Debate** - Without trustee advocates for parental transparency, important discussions happen behind closed doors
2. **Curriculum Concerns** - Parents' questions about what's being taught in classrooms may not receive adequate board-level attention
3. **Spending Priorities** - Budget decisions may not align with parent priorities for classroom resources and academic programs

## How Did We Get Here?

School board elections typically see low turnout, and many parents aren't aware of:
- When elections occur
- Who the candidates are
- Where candidates stand on key issues
- How to research voting records

This information gap allows special interests to dominate board composition.

## The Path Forward

### Short-Term Actions

**Attend Board Meetings**
The first Tuesday of each month, parents can:
- Observe decision-making in real-time
- Submit public comments
- Show board members that parents are paying attention

**Stay Informed**
Orange United provides:
- Meeting summaries in plain language
- Voting record tracking
- Analysis of policy proposals
- Background on board decisions

### Long-Term Solutions

**Support Parent-Focused Candidates**
The next board election is an opportunity to:
- Recruit candidates who will advocate for parental transparency
- Support campaigns of like-minded trustees
- Turn out parent voters in higher numbers

**Build Coalition**
No single parent can change board composition, but together we can:
- Share information through social networks
- Organize voter registration drives
- Create accountability through sustained attention

## Your Voice Matters

Even with the current 7-0 dynamic, parent engagement makes a difference. Board members are elected officials who respond to constituent pressure. When hundreds of parents:

- Pack board meetings
- Submit public comments
- Write to trustees
- Organize community meetings

The board takes notice.
