## Your Voice Matters

As parents, we have both rights and responsibilities when it comes to our children's education. This guide helps you understand what you're entitled to and how to effectively advocate for your child.

### Curriculum Access

**You have the right to:**

- Review all curriculum materials used in your child's classroom
- Request detailed information about instructional methods
- Opt your child out of specific curriculum components (with proper notice)
- Access sample assignments and assessments

### School Board Participation

**You can:**

- Attend all public school board meetings
- Submit public comments (typically 2-3 minutes per speaker)
- Request agenda items be added for future meetings
- Access meeting minutes and voting records

### Communication with Teachers and Administrators

**Best practices:**

1. **Start with the teacher** - Most issues can be resolved at the classroom level
2. **Document everything** - Keep records of emails, meetings, and conversations
3. **Know the chain of command** - Teacher → Principal → District Office → Board
4. **Be solution-oriented** - Come with suggestions, not just complaints

### When to Get Help

Consider reaching out to parent advocacy groups like Orange United when:

- You're not getting responses from school officials
- You need help understanding policy or procedures

- You'd like support attending or speaking at board meetings
