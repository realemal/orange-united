## The Simple Ask

Every Friday afternoon, parents should receive a brief email or portal update showing:

- **This week's lessons** in core subjects (what was taught, not just topics)
- **Next week's preview** so parents can prepare conversations at home
- **Any changes** to curriculum materials or teaching methods
- **Resources** parents can use to support learning at home

This isn't complicated. This isn't controversial. This is basic respect for the people who entrust their children to our schools.

---

## Why This Matters

**Right now, most Orange parents have no idea what their kids are learning day-to-day.**

- No consistent updates
- No clear curriculum roadmap shared with families
- Changes happen without notice
- Parents find out about new programs from their confused children—not from the district

**This isn't transparency. It's a black box.**

And when parents ask questions, they're often met with:
- "Check the website" (which is outdated)
- "Trust the experts"
- "This is how it's always been done"

Parents aren't asking to rewrite lesson plans. They're asking to **know what's being taught** to their own children.

## What Transparency Looks Like

### **1. Weekly Classroom Snapshot**

A simple template every teacher completes in 10 minutes:

**Math:** We covered fractions using pizza models. Students practiced 1/2, 1/4, 1/3 equivalents.  
**Reading:** Finished *Charlotte's Web* chapters 5-7. Discussed themes of friendship and loyalty.  
**Science:** Learned about plant photosynthesis. Did leaf observation activity.  
**Social Studies:** Studied California missions. Students built mission models (due next Friday).

**Next Week:** Starting multiplication tables in math; beginning new novel *Bridge to Terabithia*.

---

### **2. Curriculum Materials Portal**

Parents should be able to log in and see:
- The textbooks being used (with digital access if available)
- Supplemental materials and worksheets
- Any new teaching resources introduced
- Videos or apps students are using

**If a district is using it, parents should be able to see it.**

---

### **3. Notice of Changes**

Any time curriculum materials change (new books, new programs, new teaching methods), parents get notice **before** implementation—not after.

**Example:**
> "Starting November 15, 3rd-grade math will incorporate [Program Name]. Parents can review the materials here: [link]. Questions? Contact your child's teacher or attend the info session on Nov 10."

## The Opposition Will Say...

**"This is too much work for teachers."**  
→ A 10-minute Friday template is less than teachers already spend on administrative tasks. Districts can provide training and streamline the process.

**"Parents don't need to micromanage classrooms."**  
→ Knowing what your child is learning isn't micromanaging. It's basic parental involvement.

**"Curriculum is too complex for parents to understand."**  
→ Teachers explain complex concepts to 7-year-olds every day. They can summarize key points for parents.

**"This will lead to constant complaints."**  
→ **Good.** If parents have concerns, schools should hear them. That's called accountability.

---

## How This Gets Done

### **School Board Action Required:**

1. **Adopt a Weekly Communication Policy**
   - Mandate weekly classroom updates for K-8 (minimum)
   - Require curriculum materials to be accessible online
   - Set timeline: pilot program in January, full rollout by next school year

2. **Allocate Resources**
   - Provide simple template for teachers
   - Set up parent portal (many districts already have this infrastructure)
   - Train teachers on efficient communication (single training session)

3. **Accountability**
   - Track compliance (are updates going out weekly?)
   - Gather parent feedback
   - Adjust based on what works

---

## What Parents Can Do Right Now

1. **Email your child's teacher** and ask for a weekly update. Be specific:
   - "Can you share what topics you'll cover each week?"
   - "Where can I access the curriculum materials?"
   - "How can I support learning at home?"

2. **Attend the next board meeting** and request a communication policy during public comment. (First Tuesday of every month, 6pm, [1401 N. Handy Street](https://goo.gl/maps/example))

3. **Email the board** directly:
   - Board contact: [board@orangeusd.org](mailto:board@orangeusd.org)
   - Individual trustees: [See contact info here](/school-board)

4. **Connect with other parents** who want the same thing. You're not alone.

## The Bottom Line

**If a district won't tell parents what's being taught, parents have every right to ask why.**

Orange parents deserve:
- ✅ Weekly updates on classroom activities
- ✅ Access to curriculum materials
- ✅ Advance notice of changes
- ✅ Clear communication from schools

This isn't radical. This is respect.

**Resumen en español:**

Los padres de Orange merecen actualizaciones semanales simples sobre lo que sus hijos aprenden en clase: qué lecciones se enseñaron, qué viene la próxima semana, y acceso a los materiales del plan de estudios. Esto no es complicado ni controversia—es respeto básico por las familias. La junta escolar debe adoptar una política de comunicación semanal, proporcionar plantillas simples para maestros, y hacer que los materiales estén disponibles en línea. Los padres pueden actuar ahora enviando correos electrónicos a los maestros, asistiendo a reuniones de la junta, y conectándose con otros padres que desean lo mismo.
