## Follow the Money

**Orange Unified School District's budget is over $200 million annually.**

Ask most parents where that money goes, and they'll say: "Teachers, textbooks, and classrooms."

But look at the actual spending, and you'll find:
- **Administrative overhead** consuming larger percentages every year
- **Outside consultants** billing hundreds of thousands for "studies" and "training"
- **New programs** that require expensive licensing and ongoing fees
- Meanwhile: **teachers buying classroom supplies** with their own money

**It's time to flip the script: Classrooms first. Everything else second.**

---

## The Problem: Budget Bloat

### **1. Administrative Spending is Growing**

Orange USD, like many California districts, has seen administrative costs grow faster than instructional spending over the past decade.

**What this means:**
- More central office positions
- Higher salaries for administrators vs. teachers
- Less money reaching actual classrooms

**Example:**  
For every dollar spent on a new assistant superintendent, that's $120,000+ not going to classroom teachers, aides, or materials.

---

### **2. Consultant Contracts are Out of Control**

Districts routinely hire outside consultants for:
- **Equity audits** ($50K-$200K)
- **Professional development** (often mandated by the state)
- **Curriculum reviews** ($100K+)
- **Strategic planning** ($75K-$150K)

**The problem:**  
Many of these consultants deliver generic reports, offer training that teachers find unhelpful, and then disappear—leaving no lasting benefit.

**Real question:**  
Could those funds hire 2-3 more teachers instead? Could they buy new science lab equipment? Could they fund after-school tutoring?

---

### **3. "Innovative" Programs Drain Ongoing Budgets**

Every few years, districts adopt new programs that sound great in presentations:
- New math curriculum with digital subscriptions ($200K+/year)
- Social-emotional learning platforms ($100K+/year)
- Data dashboards and assessment tools ($150K+/year)

**These add up fast. And once adopted, they're hard to cut** because contracts lock districts in for 3-5 years.

Meanwhile:
- **Teachers are still buying pencils, paper, and tissues** out of pocket
- **Libraries have outdated books**
- **Science labs lack basic equipment**
- **Class sizes grow** because there's "no money" to hire more teachers

---

## What "Classrooms First" Actually Means

### **1. Prioritize Direct Classroom Spending**

**At least 60% of the budget** should go directly to classrooms:
- Teacher salaries and benefits
- Classroom aides and support staff
- Textbooks and instructional materials
- Technology that students actually use (computers, software)
- Classroom supplies

**Track it publicly.** Every year, the district should report:  
"This year, X% of our budget went directly to classrooms."

---

### **2. Cut Unnecessary Consultants**

**New policy: No consultant contract over $50,000** without:
1. **Public justification** at a board meeting (What problem does this solve? What are the expected outcomes?)
2. **Proof that internal staff can't do it** (Why can't our own teachers or admin handle this?)
3. **Measurable results** (How will we know if this was worth the money?)

**And require post-contract reports:** Did the consultant deliver value? Should we renew?

---

### **3. Fund Teachers, Not Bureaucracy**

**Teacher-to-administrator ratio matters.**

If Orange USD has 1,500 students:
- **Good ratio:** 50 teachers, 5 administrators
- **Bad ratio:** 45 teachers, 10 administrators

**Every time we choose to hire another coordinator, director, or assistant superintendent, we're choosing NOT to hire a classroom teacher.**

**Classrooms first means: Freeze administrative hiring. Invest in teachers.**

---

### **4. Transparent, Line-Item Budget**

Parents should be able to see:
- **How much is spent on consultants** (by category)
- **How much goes to administrative salaries** vs. teacher salaries
- **Every major contract** over $25,000

**Post it online. Update it quarterly. Make it searchable.**

If a district won't show parents where the money goes, parents have every right to ask why.

---

## The Opposition Will Say...

**"Administrative positions are required by the state."**  
→ Some are. Many aren't. And even required positions can be shared across districts (like special education coordinators). We need audits to prove which roles are truly necessary.

**"Consultants bring expertise we don't have."**  
→ Sometimes true. But often, experienced teachers and staff could deliver the same training or analysis—if given time and resources. Invest in your own people first.

**"Cutting programs will hurt students."**  
→ Keeping bloated budgets and underfunded classrooms hurts students **more**. Every dollar wasted on a useless consultant is a dollar not spent on a teacher, a textbook, or a classroom aide.

**"We're already tight on funds."**  
→ Then why are we still paying for consultants, adding admin positions, and renewing expensive program contracts? Tighten where it doesn't hurt kids. Protect what does.

## What the Budget Should Look Like

### **Hypothetical $200M Budget**

**Current (example):**
- Instruction (teachers, materials): 55% ($110M)
- Administration: 15% ($30M)
- Facilities: 10% ($20M)
- Consultants & outside services: 5% ($10M)
- Everything else: 15% ($30M)

**Classrooms-First Budget:**
- Instruction (teachers, materials): **65%** ($130M) ← **+$20M more to classrooms**
- Administration: **10%** ($20M) ← Freeze new hires, cut unnecessary positions
- Facilities: 10% ($20M) ← Keep (safety matters)
- Consultants & outside services: **2%** ($4M) ← Cut non-essential contracts
- Everything else: 13% ($26M)

**That's $20 million more** going directly to classrooms.  
**That's 150+ new teachers. Or smaller class sizes. Or updated textbooks for every student.**

## What Parents Need to Demand

### **From the School Board:**

1. **Adopt a "Classrooms First" Budget Policy**
   - At least 60% of spending must be direct classroom instruction
   - No consultant contracts over $50K without board approval + public justification
   - Annual report on percentage of budget reaching classrooms

2. **Freeze Administrative Growth**
   - No new central office positions without eliminating an existing one
   - Prioritize classroom teacher hiring over admin hiring
   - Audit current admin positions: which are truly necessary?

3. **Transparent Budget Dashboard**
   - Post all contracts over $25K online
   - Show teacher-to-admin ratios
   - Track consultant spending by category

4. **Invest in Teachers**
   - Competitive salaries to attract and retain great teachers
   - Classroom supply budgets (so teachers stop paying out of pocket)
   - Professional development that teachers actually find useful (not generic consultants)

---

## What Parents Can Do Right Now

1. **Request the budget**
   - Email: [budget@orangeusd.org](mailto:budget@orangeusd.org)
   - Ask for: "Full line-item budget, including all consultant contracts and admin salaries"
   - It's public information—they must provide it

2. **Attend budget meetings**
   - Districts hold public budget workshops before adopting the annual budget (usually spring)
   - Show up. Ask questions. Demand transparency.

3. **Track consultant spending**
   - Board agendas list new contracts
   - Note which consultants get hired and for how much
   - Ask: "What did we get for this money?"

4. **Speak at board meetings**
   - Public comment: "I'm asking the board to adopt a Classrooms First budget policy and freeze administrative hiring."
   - Bring specific examples (consultant contracts, admin growth)

---

## The Bottom Line

**Every dollar not spent in the classroom is a dollar wasted.**

Orange students deserve:
- ✅ More teachers, not more administrators
- ✅ Updated textbooks and materials, not consultant reports gathering dust
- ✅ Smaller class sizes, not bloated central office budgets
- ✅ Transparency in spending, not hidden line items

**If Orange USD can afford consultants, it can afford to fully fund classrooms.**

It's time to make that choice.

**Resumen en español:**

El presupuesto de Orange USD debe priorizar el gasto directo en el aula: maestros, libros de texto y materiales, no gastos administrativos y consultores externos. Al menos el 60% del presupuesto debe ir directamente a las aulas. Los contratos de consultores superiores a $50,000 deben requerir justificación pública y resultados medibles. Congelar la contratación administrativa y auditar los puestos actuales. Crear un panel de presupuesto transparente que muestre todos los contratos, proporciones de maestros a administradores, y gastos de consultores. Invertir en maestros con salarios competitivos, presupuestos para suministros de aula, y desarrollo profesional útil. Los padres deben solicitar el presupuesto completo, asistir a reuniones presupuestarias, rastrear gastos de consultores, y hablar en reuniones de la junta exigiendo transparencia.
