        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>
          Orange United provides nonpartisan education information to help Orange parents stay informed 
          about school board decisions, curriculum changes, and opportunities to engage in their children's education.
        </p>

        <h2>501(c)(4) Compliance</h2>
        <p>
          Orange United is a 501(c)(4) social welfare organization. We focus on education and civic engagement, 
          not political campaigns. We do not:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Endorse or oppose candidates for public office</li>
          <li>Coordinate with or support political campaigns</li>
          <li>Make our primary purpose the support or opposition of candidates</li>
          <li>Engage in partisan political activity</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What We Do</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Educate:</strong> Provide factual information about school board meetings and education policy</li>
          <li><strong>Document:</strong> Track and report voting records on education issues</li>

          <li><strong>Facilitate:</strong> Help parents understand how to participate in the public process</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Sourcing Standards</h2>
