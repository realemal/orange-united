          <h2>Our Mission</h2>
          <p>
            Orange United is a grassroots movement of parents, educators, and community members 
            committed to excellence in Orange education. We believe that when parents and schools 
            work together, our children thrive.
          </p>

          <h2>What We Do</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Keep Parents Informed:</strong> We cover school board meetings, curriculum changes, 
              and education policy so you don't have to sift through hours of meetings.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Promote Transparency:</strong> We advocate for open communication between 
              schools, administrators, and families.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Empower Parent Voices:</strong> We provide resources and opportunities for parents 
              to engage meaningfully in their children's education.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Build Community:</strong> We connect like-minded parents who care about 
              educational excellence and student success.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Our Values</h2>
          <p>
            We believe in academic excellence, parental involvement, transparency in governance, 
            and community engagement. Every child deserves a quality education, and every parent 
            deserves to have a voice in how that education is delivered.
          </p>

          <h2>Get Involved</h2>
          <p>
            Whether you want to volunteer, stay informed, or simply connect with other parents, 
            there's a place for you in Orange United. Together, we can make a difference.
